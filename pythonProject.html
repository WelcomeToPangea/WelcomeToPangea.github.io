    <p>The video provided above shows the running of the game against the AI bot. The 
    intended pupose of the program is to play Nim until you can master it and win
    against the bot (As shown).</p>
    <p> One difficulty that was encountered was the printing of the stones. 
    Originaly the stone piles were printed horizontally all in the same print function. 
    Naturaly, this caused issues as the variables used for each pile had to be nested
    inside eachother for a total of 64 combinations spanning across a maximum of 9 turn 
    fuctions. The way this was fixed, is I implemented 3 seperate functions that stored 
    the pile values and printed the piles verically so I only had to code 4 possibilities
    of each pile. One opporotunity we encountered was the chance to create a looping turn 
    system, as opposed to 9 turn functions that led to the next one. This was achieved 
    through playerTurn values that set the turn value equal to the player 
    playing next, either =1 or = 2. This player vs player function was easily transfered 
    to the AI as well, simplifying and shortening the code as a whole. One part of the 
    code I completed independantly was the Player vs Player portion of the game where 
    players take turns taking stones as opposed to the algorithmic functions of the bot.</p>
